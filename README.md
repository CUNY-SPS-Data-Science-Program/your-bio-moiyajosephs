Hello! My name is Moiya Josephs. I go by Moiya. The best way to contact me is by my school email: moiya.josephs71@spsmail.cuny.edu. I am currently a data analyst. My most proficient coding language is Python, then R. I also can code in JavaScript, although I've only used the language in frameworks like Angular. I have no knowledge or experience of the Geographic Information System. 

My current career objective is to apply the skills I learn from this program to work in a nonprofit environment. My goal for this course is to convey information through visuals properly. I also want to get stronger in visualization tools like Plotly, D3, and Tableau.
